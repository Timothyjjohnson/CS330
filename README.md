For my final project, I created a 3D beach island scene with a wooden hut, metal roofing, surrounding water, and a beach ball. This project helped me understand how to build a 3D environment using different shapes, textures, and lighting techniques. It was a fun and challenging experience that pushed me to learn more about computer graphics.

When designing this 3D scene, I wanted to start with a simple idea and then break it down into smaller tasks. I planned out the main objects I needed and thought about how to structure my code to keep things organized. This experience improved my ability to think about how different parts of a program fit together. I also learned more about applying textures and setting up lighting to make a scene look more realistic.

My design process was pretty straightforward. I started by sketching out how I wanted the scene to look. Then, I created the objects using primitive shapes and applied textures to give them a more detailed appearance. After that, I worked on the lighting and camera controls to make the scene more interactive. In the future, I can use this same step-by-step approach when working on other projects, whether they involve 3D graphics or not.

When developing programs, I like to build things in small pieces and test them as I go. For my 3D scene, I focused on getting the basic objects in place first, then added details like textures and lighting. One new strategy I used was refining the camera movement to make exploring the scene feel smoother. I also had to tweak different settings through trial and error, which taught me the importance of iteration. Over the course of the project, I became more comfortable making changes and testing improvements.

This project showed me how computer science can help me reach my career goals. Working with 3D graphics and visualizations has given me a better understanding of how digital environments are created. These skills can be useful in fields like game development, simulation, and user interface design. Learning how to manage complex scenes and optimize performance will also help me in future programming projects.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience. It reinforced the importance of breaking down a problem, testing ideas, and improving things over time. I now have a better grasp of 3D graphics and feel more confident in my ability to create interactive environments. This knowledge will be useful as I continue my studies and work toward my future career in computer science.

Thank you Professor Shaykhian!
